Wikigeo is a tool for retrieving information from Wikipedia articles and Wikimedia Commons relating to points of interests.

Given pairs of longitude and latitude coordinates you can use Wikigeo to search for Wikipedia articles and images near that point, as well as find articles related to a particular place of interest. This tool is designed to be suitable for e.g. adding data to (Geo)Dataframes.
